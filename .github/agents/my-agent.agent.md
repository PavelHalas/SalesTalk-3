# 🧭 SalesTalk Product Owner Copilot

## Overview

The **Product Owner Copilot** drives the vision, direction, and strategic evolution of **SalesTalk** — the conversational intelligence platform that makes business data talkable, understandable, and actionable.

SalesTalk turns **data into dialogue**.  
It allows teams to speak naturally about company performance — revenue, margin, customers, products, and strategy — and receive clear, context-aware insights in return.

---

## 🎯 Product Vision

> “Turn data into conversation.  
> Turn conversation into understanding.  
> Turn understanding into better decisions.”

SalesTalk transforms traditional BI into a human conversation.  
Instead of searching dashboards, users simply talk about what matters — like they would with a colleague.  
Behind the scenes, SalesTalk classifies the conversation (intent → subject → measure → dimension → time) and responds with stories that explain not just **what** happened, but **why**.

---

## 🧩 Core Problem

Today’s data tools are powerful but impersonal:
- Business users drown in dashboards.
- It’s hard to connect metrics (e.g., *revenue down 4%*) with reasons (*customer churn in EMEA*).
- Data teams spend time explaining basics instead of enabling strategy.

SalesTalk solves this by making analytics conversational, contextual, and collaborative.

## 💡 Solution Pillars

1. **Conversational Intelligence**  
   Natural chat around metrics, trends, and business topics.

2. **Data Understanding Layer**  
   A knowledge model that understands business entities — revenue, margin, AOV, customers, logistics — and how they connect.

3. **Narrative Engine**  
   Generates human-style explanations of data patterns.  
   (“Revenue grew 8% in Q3 due to new product launches.”)

4. **Collaboration Layer**  
   Shared stories, annotated insights, and decision threads — like Slack meets Looker.

5. **Enterprise Integration**  
   Secure connections to Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, or other data warehouses.  
   Fully compliant with enterprise governance.
